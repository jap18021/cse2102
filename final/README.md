### Final Lab Setup - CSE2102 (Team Otters)

# 1. Initialize the program

First, get the program onto your machine.

## 1.1 Clone Repository

Load this program onto your local machine. This can be done by running this command in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jap18021/cse2102.git
```

## 1.2 Adjust Directory

Make sure that you are in the correct directory. Navigate to Lab 0 with `cd cse2102/final/quiz` in the terminal.

# 2. Start the quiz... if you dare.

It's called a quiz but it seems more menacing than that... perhaps this _quiz_ will decide my fate?

Run `npm run start` to get the quiz going in a web browser.

### Everything should run properly!
